# research-utils v0.2.0 release notes

Release date: 2026-02-12

## Highlights

- Completed v0.2 roadmap commitments for optimization composition + agent tooling.
- Added optional CMA-ES strategy support behind `cma` dependency guardrails.
- Locked deterministic reporting with canonical run-summary schemas and tests.

## Included v0.2 capabilities

- **Optimization strategies**
  - `RandomStrategy`, `SobolStrategy`, and optional `CMAESStrategy` with deterministic seeding behavior.
  - Composable `StagedStrategy` and `PortfolioStrategy` under shared ask/tell contracts.
- **Constraint handling v1**
  - Deterministic penalty conversion path integrated into `OptimizationRunner` for failure/constraint handling.
- **Agent tooling v1**
  - Deterministic experiment script generation with metadata/provenance headers.
  - Repository guardrail checks for seed policy, seed argument, config hash, provenance, and parameter-path validity.
  - Deterministic repository introspection report generation.
- **Reporting stabilization**
  - Canonical sweep/optimization summary builders and stable JSON serialization schema.

## Compatibility and dependency notes

- `phys-pipeline` remains optional and adapter-scoped.
- ML extras continue to gate optional optimization dependencies (`scipy`, `cma`).
- Public contracts (`EvalResult`, `SweepResult`, `OptimizationHistory`, `ParameterSpace`) remain stable in v0.2.0.

## Validation summary

- Lint/format checks pass via pre-commit.
- Strict mypy checks pass for `src` and `tests`.
- Fast pytest suite (`-m "not slow"`) passes with deterministic and contract coverage for v0.2 features.
